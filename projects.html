	        <p>Graphing is an iOS app, written in Objective-C with CocoaTouch,
	        for both the iPhone and iPod Touch that allows the user to
	        manipulate simple graphs to find isomorphic graphs.</p>
	        
	        <p>The user uses an adjacency matrix to input adjacencies between
	        six vertices, and then can see the resulting graph with the
	        vertices in a C6 position. Then, the user can move around the
	        vertices to find any isomorphic graph they desire.</p>
	        
	        <p>A cool use of the program is to move the vertices around to try
	        to find a planar isomorphic graph, or to find a K5 or K(3,3) graph
	        to prove that it is non-planar.</p>

			<p>Gravity.app is a program, written in Objective-C for the Mac, 
			that simulates Newtonian Gravity between any number of circles 
			on a 2D plane.</p>
			
			<p>The Gravitational Constant has been changed from 6.11x10^-11 
			to 6.11x10^-1 to allow for the effects of gravity to show 
			more drastically to the user (otherwise, almost nothing seems 
			to happen).</p>
			
			<p>A cool way to use the program is to create two objects, one
			with a mass of 1000, a position of (0, 0), and a velocity of
			(0, 0), and another with a mass of 0, a position of (100, 0),
			and a velocity of (0, 2.5). This results in a near-circular
			orbit.</p>

			<header>Cobbler</header>
			<a class="button" href="http://altece.com/Cobbler/">Official Project Page</a>

			<p>Cobbler is an attempt to add objects to the C language in order to better understand the implementations of different kinds of object systems. It is a primitive static object system developed using just C Macros and functions. Eventuallu, it will support a dynamic object system library created using the primative object system.</p>

			<header>BetterBuses</header>
			<a class="button" href="http://altece.com/BetterBuses/">Official Project Page</a>

			<p>Bus schedules can be hard and convluted to read. When you want to get from pont A to point B, you are required to inherently know which bus route that applies to, and you're supposed to inherently know what all the little symols mean, and if you don't understand, you need to hunt down the key and are forced to figure it out.</p>

			<p>Computers today can do all the hard work for you, leaving you with the right information needed to get from pont A to point B at any time you wish.</p>

			<p>Better Busses is aimed to convert RIT's bus schedules first into a computer-friendly format, so that they may present the information to humans in a friendly maner.</p>

            <a class="button" href="http://altece.com/Chunktional">Official Project Page</a>

            <p>This is a collection of C Macros to put together abstract data types and pattern matching similar to that found in functional programming languages like Haskell and SML.</p>
