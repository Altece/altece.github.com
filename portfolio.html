<p>A collection of short poems written while I was taking an "Experiments and Explorations in Writing" class. The class was all together fun, and I heavily enjoyed the experimental poetic writing. Playing with words and how they were read was quite the experience.</p>

<p>While in a Vector Imaging class instructing how to use Adobe Illustrator, an assignment was given to create four three-month calendars illustrating the months they contain. I decided to illustrate the four seasons with a semi-subtle abstract representation of the mood or feeling of the seasons as they change month-to-month. The result was a collection of an illustration of the sky and ground throughout the seasons, showing time progressing into the seasons through the months from the top to the bottom of each calendar.</p>

<p>Planets are cool. While in my Vector Imaging class, one project was to create album artwork. A common theme when I listen to music is space--when I listen to music, I tend fall into a fantasy of surreal futuristic space images--so I decided to depict a planet in the dark of space. I found an image of Earth and began to trace the shapes of land masses. Soon thereafter, I began adding clouds and an atmosphere, and eventually a black and burple nebula cloud behind the planet to give it a nice hubble look.</p>
