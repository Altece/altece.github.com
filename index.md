Gradutaed from the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu/), 
I received a batchelors in [Computer Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) 
with a minor in [Deaf Cultural Studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_culture).

I have interests in histories, evolutions, sciences, and philosophies. These 
interests can manifest as a passion for human communication and its evolution 
through time, or an urge to learn more about the universe we inhabit. Subjects
which spark the flame of intreague within include, but are not limited to:

- [Human-Computer Interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human–computer_interaction)
- [Linguistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics)
	- [Etymology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology)
	- [Historical Linguistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics)
	- [Linguistic Anthropology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropological_linguistics)
	- [Internet Linguistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_linguistics)
	- [Writing Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system)
	- [Typography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography)
	- [ASL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language), [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language)
- [Programming Languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and [Programming Language Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory)
- [Physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics)
	- [Modern Physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics)
	- [Quantum Mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)
	- [Theoritical Physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics)

##Skills

###Acquired Programming Languages

- [Objective-C](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html)
	- An attempt to jam [Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk)-style dynamic objects within C.
	  I'd call it a success, or at least close enough.
	- Tought myself the basics of the language, then went to Apple Cocoa Camp 2011 where
	  I formally learned iOS development.
	- Using the dynamic object system, I've created classes which automatically implement
	  their methods based on the method name and class name. It was pretty cool.
- [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097)
	- Apple's hip new cool shiny modern language whose goal in life is to make programming
	  safer for everyone.
	- Since many of the ideas introduced in this new language are in ML-languages,
	  and since the semantics are heavily infulenced by C++ and C#, learning this
	  language came easily.
- [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
	- Two classic languages every programmer's heard of. Their aim is efficiency and speed.
	- Many of my personal projects are done in C, such as [Reggie the Regex Parser](http://altece.com/Reggie-the-Regex-Parser/)
	  and [Chunktional](http://altece.com/Chunktional). These projects helped build 
	  up my thurough understanding of C macros and semantics.
	- Understanding C semantics and programming styles/patterns lead me to a better
	  understanding of the semantics and purpose of C++. This has given me a good
	  sense of when using certain C++ features makes the most sense, and when others
	  would just get in the way of writing good code.
- [Google's Go](http://www.golang.org)
	- Go has a great channel and coroutine based concurrency model which reveal
	  [concurrency patterns](http://blog.golang.org/advanced-go-concurrency-patterns) 
	  that would spoil any programmer.
- [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)
	- My first introduction to the magical world of [curried functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying), 
	  [strong types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing),
	  [type inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference), and 
	  [sum types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union).
	- My life as a programmer was forever changed after learning this language.
- [Standard ML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML)
	- My first ML.
	- Yet another great strongly-type-inferred functional language.
- [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language))
	- My first functional language.
	- Through playing with this language, I accidentally learned the lambda calculus
	  while trying to create an iterative fibonacci sequence function using anonymous
	  functions.
- [MIPS Assembly](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MIPS_Assembly)
	- My first assembly language.
	- Tought myself by writing a recursive fibonacci sequence.
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
	- A great scripting language which I mostly use for manipulating large amounts of text.
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
	- Another scripting language.
- [C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx)
	- Microsoft's answer to Java, C# is a nice language with some modern programming
	  paradigm ideas, such as anonymous functions (called delegates).
- [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
	- A good language for teaching Object-Oriented design. 
	- The JVM is a good piece of technology too. 
	- The language could use some work, but with Java 1.8 they're starting to move in 
	  the right direction.
- [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
	- An awful language we have to live with.
	- I've heard good things about ECMAScript 6, so hopefully that works out.
- [AppleScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript)
	- I learned this just because I thought it was a cool idea, eve if it's not very
	  pratical for "real" programming.
	- This is cool in that it is heavily infulenced by [Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), 
	  using a VM where the saved program code and the binary running file, along with 
	  saved state, are one-in-the-same.
	- It had some really interesting ideas as a language. It's too bad it never really 
	  cought on.

###Languages I'm Learning

- [American Sign Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language)
	- Not yet fluent, I consider myself "conversational". I've studied for three years
	and enjoy every chance I get to sign.
- [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language)
	- Still learning this language. My grammar is very good, but my vocabulary
	  is weak and needs a lot of work. I need to try conversing more to build
	  up confidence and vocabulary.
	- My favorite character, by the way, is [ß (Eszett)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ß),
	  which has a really cool history.
- [Cyrillic Script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script)
	- I'm still familiarizing myself with this writing system. My favorite
	  character is [Ж ж (pronounced "zhe", like the 's' in "measure")](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhe_(Cyrillic)).

<!--
I have an interest in Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design 
and Experience. Computers are interesting due to their ability to introduce 
new methods and paradigms for allowing people to consume information in new 
and innovative ways. There are a few projects that I believe demonstrate the 
as-of-yet untapped potential of computers.

I also enjoy graphic design and typography. Somewhat as a tie-in to my 
interests with User Interface Design, the layout of information in both 
digital and printed format is a great subject of interest. How people read 
is impacted by how the information is presented in the visual sense. I feel 
that knowing what looks and feels good is an important skill to have.
