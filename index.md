Gradutaed from the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu/), 
I received a batchelors in [Computer Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) 
with a minor in [Deaf Cultural Studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_culture).

I have interests in histories, evolutions, sciences, and philosophies. These 
interests can manifest as a passion for human communication and its evolution 
through time, or an urge to learn more about the universe we inhabit. Subjects
which spark the flame of intreague within include, but are not limited to

###Languages I'm Learning

- [ASL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language)

	- I'm not yet fluent, but I consider myself 'conversational', as I can 
	carry a conversation with little trouble.

- [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language)

	- Still learning this language. My grammar is very good, but my vocabulary
	is weak and needs a lot of work. I need to try conversing more to build
	up confidence and vocabulary.

	- My favorite character, by the way, is [ß (Eszett)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ß),
	which has a really cool history.

- [Cyrillic Script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script)

	- I'm still familiarizing myself with this writing system. My favorite
	character is [Ж ж (pronounced 'zhe')](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhe_(Cyrillic)).

<!--
I have an interest in Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design 
and Experience. Computers are interesting due to their ability to introduce 
new methods and paradigms for allowing people to consume information in new 
and innovative ways. There are a few projects that I believe demonstrate the 
as-of-yet untapped potential of computers.

I also enjoy graphic design and typography. Somewhat as a tie-in to my 
interests with User Interface Design, the layout of information in both 
digital and printed format is a great subject of interest. How people read 
is impacted by how the information is presented in the visual sense. I feel 
that knowing what looks and feels good is an important skill to have.
