I majored in [Computer Science][cs] at [RIT][rit], and minored in [Deaf Cultural Studies][deaf].

[cs]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science 
[rit]: http://www.rit.edu/
[deaf]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_culture

My interests include linguistics, physics, mathematics, [programming language theory][plt], [human-computer interaction][hci]. These passions fuel an urge to learn more about the universe we inhabit.

# Knowledge

## Programming Languages

[Objective-C](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html)
: An attempt to jam [Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk)-style dynamic objects within C.
  I'd call it a success, or at least close enough.

[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097)
: A much safer language than Objective-C, Swift takes inspiration from a variety of languages
  and tries to learn from their mistakes while reaping the bennifits.
: I find the best features tend to be inspired from ML-languages, C++, C#, and Objective-C of course.

[C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
: Two classic languages every programmer's heard of. Their aim is efficiency and speed.
: Some of my personal projects have been in C, such as [Reggie the Regex Parser]

[Go](http://www.golang.org)
: Go's amazing channel and coroutine based concurrency model reveal
  [concurrency patterns](http://blog.golang.org/advanced-go-concurrency-patterns) 
  that would spoil any programmer.

[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)
: My first introduction to the magical world of
  [curried functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying),
  [strong types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing),
  [type inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference),
    and [sum types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union).
: My life as a programmer was forever changed after learning this language.

[Standard ML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML)
: My first ML.
: Yet another great strongly-type-inferred functional language.

[Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language))
: My first functional language.
: Through playing with this language, I accidentally learned the lambda calculus
  while trying to create an iterative fibonacci sequence function using anonymous
  functions.

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
: A great scripting language which I mostly use for manipulating large amounts of text.

[C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx)
: Microsoft's answer to Java, C# is a nice language with some modern programming
  paradigm ideas, such as anonymous functions (called delegates).

[F#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233154.aspx)
: Microsoft's ML-style functional language, infulenced by OCaml.
: Designed to run on the .Net Runtime and be compatible with all of Microsoft's APIs.
: Somewhat strange to program with. Programming with object-oriented APIs in a functional
  language is strange. The resulting programs have a weird blend of APIs from both worlds.

[Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
: A good language for teaching Object-Oriented design. 
: The JVM is a good piece of technology too. 
: The language could use some work, but with Java 1.8 they're starting to move in 
  the right direction.

[AppleScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript)
: I learned this just because I thought it was a cool idea, even if it's not very
  pratical for "real" programming.
: This is cool in that it is heavily infulenced by [Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), 
  using a VM where the saved program code is one-and-the-same wiht the compiled binary code.
: It had some really interesting ideas as a language. It's too bad it never really 
  caught on.

# Languages I'm Learning

- [American Sign Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language)
    - Not yet fluent, I consider myself "conversational". I've studied for three years
    and enjoy every chance I get to sign.
- [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language)
    - Still learning this language. My grammar is very good, but my vocabulary
      is weak and needs a lot of work. I need to try conversing more to build
      up confidence and vocabulary.
    - My favorite character, by the way, is [ß (Eszett)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ß),
      which has a really cool history.
- [Cyrillic Script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script)
    - I'm still familiarizing myself with this writing system. My favorite
      character is [Ж ж (pronounced "zhe", like the 's' in "measure")](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhe_(Cyrillic)).

I have an interest in Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design 
and Experience. Computers are interesting due to their ability to introduce 
new methods and paradigms for allowing people to consume information in new 
and innovative ways. There are a few projects that I believe demonstrate the 
as-of-yet untapped potential of computers.

I also enjoy graphic design and typography. Somewhat as a tie-in to my 
interests with User Interface Design, the layout of information in both 
digital and printed format is a great subject of interest. How people read 
is impacted by how the information is presented in the visual sense. I feel 
that knowing what looks and feels good is an important skill to have.
