I am currently a fourth-year Computer Science major with sixth-year status 
studying at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu).
I am taking classes in American Sign Language, Mathematics, Biology,
Software Engineering, and Computer Science.

I enjoy learning about programming paradigms and techniques.
Currently, I have been inspired to learn more functional languages
such as [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) 
and [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell). 
I have also found an interest in low-level languages such as 
[MIPS Assembly](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MIPS_Assembly)--teaching myself 
how to use the stack-less language by creating a recursive fibonacci function.

Other languages I am familiar with include 
[Go, Google's compiled system-level language](http://www.golang.org),
[Objective-C for iOS and OS X](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html), Python, Ruby, C, C++, and Java.

I have an interest in Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design 
and Experience. Computers are interesting due to their ability to introduce 
new methods and paradigms for allowing people to consume information in new 
and innovative ways. There are a few projects that I believe demonstrate the 
as-of-yet untapped potential of computers.

I also enjoy graphic design and typography. Somewhat as a tie-in to my 
interests with User Interface Design, the layout of information in both 
digital and printed format is a great subject of interest. How people read 
is impacted by how the information is presented in the visual sense. I feel 
that knowing what looks and feels good is an important skill to have.
