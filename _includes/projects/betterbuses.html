<p>Bus schedules can be hard and convluted to read. When you want to get from pont A to point B, you are required to inherently know which bus route that applies to, and you're supposed to inherently know what all the little symols mean, and if you don't understand, you need to hunt down the key and are forced to figure it out.</p>

<p>Computers today can do all the hard work for you, leaving you with the right information needed to get from pont A to point B at any time you wish.</p>

<p>Better Busses is aimed to convert RIT's bus schedules first into a computer-friendly format, so that they may present the information to humans in a friendly maner.</p>
