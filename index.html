I will soon be a third-year Computer Science major with fourth-year status studying at the 
<a href="http://www.rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>.
I am taking classes in American Sign Language, Mathematics, Biology,
Software Engineering, and Computer Science.

<p>		
	I enjoy learning about programming paradigms and techniques.
	Currently, I have been inspired to learn more functional languages
	such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> 
	and <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>. 
	I have also found an interest in low-level languages such as <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MIPS_Assembly">MIPS Assembly</a>--teaching myself how to use the stack-less language by creating a recursive fibonacci function.
</p>

<p>
	Other languages I am familiar with include <a href="http://www.golang.org">Go, Google's compiled system-level language</a>,
	<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html">Objective-C for iOS and OS X</a>, Python, Ruby, C, C++, and Java.
</p>

<p>
	I have an interest in Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design and Experience. Computers are interesting due to their ability to introduce new methods and paradigms for allowing people to consume information in new and innovative ways. There are a few projects that I believe demonstrate the as-of-yet untapped potential of computers.<!--, one of them being the <a href="http://worrydream.com/KillMath/">Kill Math</a> project, demonstrating a reimagining of the user interface we use to perform and understand mathematics.-->
</p>

<p>
	I also enjoy graphic design and typography. Somewhat as a tie-in to my interests with User Interface Design, the layout of information in both digital and printed format is a great subject of interest. How people read is impacted by how the information is presented in the visual sense. I feel that knowing what looks and feels good is an important skill to have.
