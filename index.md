Hi, I'm Steve, a [Software developer][swdev]. &#x1F468;&#x1F3FB;&#x200D;&#x1F4BB;
{: .hello }

I've been making iOS apps in the [San Francisco Bay Area][sfba].

My [functional programming][fp] skills help with writing great software.

I study [American Sign Language][asl] and [German][de] in my spare time.
