## Realities

[Link to PDF on Scribd][realities]

A collection of short poems written while I was taking an "Experiments and 
Explorations in Writing" class. The class was all together fun, and I heavily 
enjoyed the experimental poetic writing. Playing with words and how they were 
read was quite the experience.

## Calendar Project

While in a Vector Imaging class instructing how to use Adobe Illustrator, 
an assignment was given to create four three-month calendars illustrating the 
months they contain. I decided to illustrate the four seasons with a semi-subtle 
abstract representation of the mood or feeling of the seasons as they change 
month-to-month. The result was a collection of an illustration of the sky and 
ground throughout the seasons, showing time progressing into the seasons through 
the months from the top to the bottom of each calendar.


## Planet

Planets are cool. While in my Vector Imaging class, one project was to create 
album artwork. A common theme when I listen to music is space--when I listen to 
music, I tend fall into a fantasy of surreal futuristic space images--so I decided 
to depict a planet in the dark of space. I found an image of Earth and began to 
trace the shapes of land masses. Soon thereafter, I began adding clouds and an 
atmosphere, and eventually a black and burple nebula cloud behind the planet to 
give it a nice hubble look.
