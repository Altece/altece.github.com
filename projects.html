	        <p>Graphing is an iOS app, written in Objective-C with CocoaTouch,
	        for both the iPhone and iPod Touch that allows the user to
	        manipulate simple graphs to find isomorphic graphs.</p>
	        
	        <p>The user uses an adjacency matrix to input adjacencies between
	        six vertices, and then can see the resulting graph with the
	        vertices in a C6 position. Then, the user can move around the
	        vertices to find any isomorphic graph they desire.</p>
	        
	        <p>A cool use of the program is to move the vertices around to try
	        to find a planar isomorphic graph, or to find a K5 or K(3,3) graph
	        to prove that it is non-planar.</p>

			<p>Gravity.app is a program, written in Objective-C for the Mac, 
			that simulates Newtonian Gravity between any number of circles 
			on a 2D plane.</p>
			
			<p>The Gravitational Constant has been changed from 6.11x10^-11 
			to 6.11x10^-1 to allow for the effects of gravity to show 
			more drastically to the user (otherwise, almost nothing seems 
			to happen).</p>
			
			<p>A cool way to use the program is to create two objects, one
			with a mass of 1000, a position of (0, 0), and a velocity of
			(0, 0), and another with a mass of 0, a position of (100, 0),
			and a velocity of (0, 2.5). This results in a near-circular
			orbit.</p>
